## Airdrop Mechanics (150M $TROLL)

### Points System (Secret - Users Don't Know!)

Users earn points through:

#### 1. **Betting Activity** (70% weight)
- **Bet Placed**: 100 points per bet
- **Volume**: 50 points per 1,000 $DEGEN wagered
- **Win Multiplier**: 2.5x points if bet wins
- **Loss Consolation**: 0.8x points (still rewarded!)

#### 2. **Win Streaks** (15% weight)
- 3 wins: +500 points
- 5 wins: +2,000 points
- 10 wins: +10,000 points
- 20 wins: +50,000 points

#### 3. **Early Adopter Bonus** (10% weight)
- First 10 users: 100,000 points 🚀
- First 50 users: 50,000 points
- First 100 users: 25,000 points
- First 500 users: 10,000 points
- First 1,000 users: 5,000 points
- First 5,000 users: 1,000 points

#### 4. **Consistency** (5% weight)
- Daily active: 100 points/day
- 7-day streak: 1,000 points
- 30-day streak: 10,000 points

### Airdrop Calculation

```
User Airdrop = (User Points / Total Points) × 150,000,000 $TROLL
```

**Example:**
- User has 100,000 points
- Total points across all users: 10,000,000
- User gets: (100,000 / 10,000,000) × 150M = **1,500,000 $TROLL** (0.15% of supply)
